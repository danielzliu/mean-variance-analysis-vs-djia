# mean-variance-analysis-vs-djia

The purpose of this project is was to investigate if a portfolio consisting of stocks in the Dow Jones Industiral Average (DJIA), optimized using mean-variance analysis, would perform better than investing in the index ETF.

The logic of the code is as following:

1. Find an optimal portfolio with expected returns and covariance matrix based on historical data.
2. Simulate the portfolio against DJIA one month in the future.
3. Update the portfolio every month.

This project was made as a bachelor thesis. The full thesis is found here:
